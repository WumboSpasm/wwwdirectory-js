            This is a JavaScript reimplementation of the <a href="https://archive.org/details/www-dir-cd"><i>World Wide Web Directory</i> CD-ROM</a> by Kris Jamsa and Ken Cope, which was sold alongside the book of the same name.
            <br>
            Released in June 1995 and boasting over 8,000 webpages, it is one of the most expansive collections of internet material predating the Internet Archive's formation in May 1996. However, its contents are packed tight inside Microsoft's proprietary Multimedia Viewer Book (.mvb) file format. With the help of a few AutoHotkey scripts and many hours of furious button mashing, the issue was alleviated. This site is the result of that effort.
            <br>
            For each page that makes up the collection, you will find its original HTML code (without images) and a screenshot of the page (with images) as it was in the first half of 1995. Categorization and keyword metadata is also available. Each in-page link will either take you to the Wayback Machine or its entry in this archive (if it exists). You can use the viewer's sidebar controls to navigate the collection or queries like the one seen above.
            <br>
